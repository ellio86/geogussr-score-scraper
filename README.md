# Geoguessr Score Scraper
**On the commandline, use the first argument to specify the results url, the results will be returned, formatted as a JSON object.**

The scraper uses the selenium chrome driver to open a browser and find the appropriate data. The purpose of this is as a module for a web app that I'm working on. This program is run in the backend and the data is served to users in a HTML frontend.
